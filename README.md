# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a predictive model for estimating the prices of cars. The dataset used for this project contains various features such as mileage, brand, year of manufacture, etc., which influence the pricing of cars. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a car based on its features.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of information about cars, including features such as mileage, brand, year of manufacture, engine size, etc. It also includes the corresponding prices of the cars. 

- `car_data.csv`: The dataset containing features and target variable (car prices).

## Methodology

1. **Data Exploration**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the dataset, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables if necessary.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms for building the predictive model.
5. **Model Training**: Train the selected models on the training dataset.
6. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained models using appropriate evaluation metrics.
7. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the models to improve performance.
8. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data using the trained model.

## Usage
